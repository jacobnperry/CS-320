    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    To ensure functionality, I focus on testing every component both individually and together.  This helps visualize how the farious functions interact with one another and how they may produce unexpexted results.  Focusing on how secure the application is has a lot to do with focusing on how buttoned up the program is, as an example if the application relies heavily on user input focusing on the sanitization of that input.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Interpreting user needs can be difficult when the client isn't entirely positive what it is they want or need.  To help with this, we can work with the client to create user stories, writing scenarios we forsee the user of the application encountering.  This will allow the development to focus on a specific process, then iterate and change the flow as needed.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    I approach it with a heavy focus on the planning phase.  Visualizing the way the application interacts with the data and the user is critical to how the development phase with go.  Having clear building blocks for the application will allow for the flow of data to make the most sense as the program gets closer to completion.
